Transferred from Inkling
========================

This Puppet module was originally authored by Inkling Systems. The maintainer preferred
that Puppet Labs take ownership of the module for future improvement and maintenance as
Puppet Labs is using it in the PuppetDB module. Existing pull requests and issues were
transferred over, please fork and continue to contribute here instead of Inkling.
Previously: https://github.com/inkling/puppet-postgresql 

Puppet module for PostgreSQL resources
======================================

This module provides the following defined resource types for managing postgres:

 * `postgresql::initdb`
 * `postgresql::db`
 * `postgresql::role`
 * `postgresql::user` (just for clarity; users are roles in postgres)
 * `postgresql::grant`

And the fallback, analogous to exec resources, only for SQL statements:

 * `postgresql::psql`

Basic usage
-----------

Manage a PostgreSQL server with sane defaults (login via `sudo -u postgres psql`):

```Puppet
include postgresql::server
```

...or a custom configuration:

```Puppet
class { 'postgresql::server':
    config_hash => {
        'ip_mask_deny_postgres_user' => '0.0.0.0/32',
        'ip_mask_allow_all_users'    => '0.0.0.0/0',
        'listen_addresses'           => '*',
        'manage_redhat_firewall'     => true,
        'postgres_password'          => 'TPSrep0rt!',
    },
}
```

Manage users / roles and permissions:

```Puppet
postgresql::user{'marmot':
    password => 'foo',
}

postgresql::grant{'grant select to marmot':
   grantee   => 'marmot',
   on_object => 'my_table',
   perm      => 'select',
   require   => Postgresql::User['marmot'],
}
```

etc, etc.


Automated testing
-----------------

Install and setup an [RVM](http://beginrescueend.com/) with 
[vagrant](http://vagrantup.com/), 
[sahara](https://github.com/jedi4ever/sahara), and 
[rspec](http://rspec.info/)

    $ curl -L get.rvm.io | bash -s stable
    $ rvm install 1.9.3
    $ rvm use --create 1.9.3@puppet-postgresql
    $ gem install vagrant sahara rspec

Run the tests like so:

    $ (cd spec; vagrant up)
    $ rspec -f -d -c

The test suite will snapshot the VM and rollback between each test.

Next, take a look at the manifests used for the automated tests.
