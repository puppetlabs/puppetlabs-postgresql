2.3.0
=====

This feature release includes the following changes:

* Add a new parameter `owner` to the `database` type.  This can be used to
  grant ownership of a new database to a specific user.  (Bruno Harbulot)
* Add support for operating systems other than Debian/RedHat, as long as the
  user supplies custom values for all of the required paths, package names, etc.
  (Chris Price)
* Improved integration testing (Ken Barber)

2.2.1
=====

This release fixes a bug whereby one of our shell commands (psql) were not ran from a globally accessible directory. This was causing permission denied errors when the command attempted to change user without changing directory.

Users of previous versions might have seen this error:

    Error: Error executing SQL; psql returned 256: 'could not change directory to "/root"

This patch should correct that.

#### Detail Changes

* Set /tmp as default CWD for postgresql_psql

2.2.0
=====

This feature release introduces a number of new features and bug fixes.

First of all it includes a new class named `postgresql::python` which provides you with a convenient way of install the python Postgresql client libraries.

    class { 'postgresql::python':
    }

You are now able to use `postgresql::database_user` without having to specify a password_hash, useful for different authentication mechanisms that do not need passwords (ie. cert, local etc.).

We've also provided a lot more advanced custom parameters now for greater control of your Postgresql installation. Consult the class documentation for PuppetDB in the README.

This release in particular has largely been contributed by the community members below, a big thanks to one and all.

#### Detailed Changes

* Add support for psycopg installation (Flaper Fesp and Dan Prince)
* Added default PostgreSQL version for Ubuntu 13.04 (Kamil Szymanski)
* Add ability to create users without a password (Bruno Harbulot)
* Three Puppet 2.6 fixes (Dominic Cleal)
* Add explicit call to concat::setup when creating concat file (Dominic Cleal)
* Fix readme typo (Jordi Boggiano)
* Update postgres_default_version for Ubuntu (Kamil Szymanski)
* Allow to set connection for noew role (Kamil Szymanski)
* Fix pg_hba_rule for postgres local access (Kamil Szymanski)
* Fix versions for travis-ci (Ken Barber)
* Add replication support (Jordi Boggiano)
* Cleaned up and added unit tests (Ken Barber)
* Generalization to provide more flexability in postgresql configuration (Karel Brezina)
* Create dependent directory for sudoers so tests work on Centos 5 (Ken Barber)
* Allow SQL commands to be run against a specific DB (Carlos Villela)
* Drop trailing comma to support Puppet 2.6 (Michael Arnold)

2.1.1
=====

This release provides a bug fix for RHEL 5 and Centos 5 systems, or specifically systems using PostgreSQL 8.1 or older. On those systems one would have received the error:

    Error: Could not start Service[postgresqld]: Execution of ‘/sbin/service postgresql start’ returned 1:

And the postgresql log entry:

    FATAL: unrecognized configuration parameter "include"

This bug is due to a new feature we had added in 2.1.0, whereby the `include` directive in `postgresql.conf` was not compatible. As a work-around we have added checks in our code to make sure systems running PostgreSQL 8.1 or older do not have this directive added.

#### Detailed Changes

2013-01-21 - Ken Barber <ken@bob.sh>
* Only install `include` directive and included file on PostgreSQL >= 8.2
* Add system tests for Centos 5

2.1.0
=====

This release is primarily a feature release, introducing some new helpful constructs to the module.

For starters, we've added the line `include 'postgresql_conf_extras.conf'` by default so extra parameters not managed by the module can be added by other tooling or by Puppet itself. This provides a useful escape-hatch for managing settings that are not currently managed by the module today.

We've added a new defined resource for managing your tablespace, so you can now create new tablespaces using the syntax:

    postgresql::tablespace { 'dbspace':
      location => '/srv/dbspace',
    }

We've added a locale parameter to the `postgresql` class, to provide a default. Also the parameter has been added to the `postgresql::database` and `postgresql::db` defined resources for changing the locale per database:

    postgresql::db { 'mydatabase':
      user     => 'myuser',
      password => 'mypassword',
      encoding => 'UTF8',
      locale   => 'en_NG',
    }

There is a new class for installing the necessary packages to provide the PostgreSQL JDBC client jars:

    class { 'postgresql::java': }

And we have a brand new defined resource for managing fine-grained rule sets within your pg_hba.conf access lists:

    postgresql::pg_hba { 'Open up postgresql for access from 200.1.2.0/24':
      type => 'host',
      database => 'app',
      user => 'app',
      address => '200.1.2.0/24',
      auth_method => 'md5',
    }

Finally, we've also added Travis-CI support and unit tests to help us iterate faster with tests to reduce regression. The current URL for these tests is here: https://travis-ci.org/puppetlabs/puppet-postgresql. Instructions on how to run the unit tests available are provided in the README for the module.

A big thanks to all those listed below who made this feature release possible :-).

Notable features:

   * Add support for versions of postgres other than the system default version
     (which varies depending on OS distro).  This includes optional support for
     automatically managing the package repo for the "official" postgres yum/apt
     repos.  (Major thanks to Etienne Pelletier <epelletier@maestrodev.com> and
     Ken Barber <ken@bob.sh> for their tireless efforts and patience on this
     feature set!)  For example usage see `tests/official-postgresql-repos.pp`.

   * Add some support for Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu Quantal

   * Add new `postgres_psql` type with a Ruby provider, to replace the old
     exec-based `psql` type.  This gives us much more flexibility around
     executing SQL statements and controlling their logging / reports output.

   * Major refactor of the "spec" tests--which are actually more like
     acceptance tests.  We now support testing against multiple OS distros
     via vagrant, and the framework is in place to allow us to very easily add
     more distros.  Currently testing against Cent6 and Ubuntu 10.04.

   * Fixed a bug that was preventing multiple databases from being owned by the
     same user
     (9adcd182f820101f5e4891b9f2ff6278dfad495c - Etienne Pelletier <epelletier@maestrodev.com>)

   * Add support for ACLs for finer-grained control of user/interface access
     (b8389d19ad78b4fb66024897097b4ed7db241930 - dharwood <harwoodd@cat.pdx.edu>)

   * Many other bug fixes and improvements!
