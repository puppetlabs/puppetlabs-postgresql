2.1.1
=====

This release provides a bug fix for RHEL 5 and Centos 5 systems, or specifically systems using PostgreSQL 8.1 or older. On those systems one would have received the error:

    Error: Could not start Service[postgresqld]: Execution of ‘/sbin/service postgresql start’ returned 1:

And the postgresql log entry:

    FATAL: unrecognized configuration parameter "include"

This bug is due to a new feature we had added in 2.1.0, whereby the `include` directive in `postgresql.conf` was not compatible. As a work-around we have added checks in our code to make sure systems running PostgreSQL 8.1 or older do not have this directive added.

#### Detailed Changes

2013-01-21 - Ken Barber <ken@bob.sh>
* Only install `include` directive and included file on PostgreSQL >= 8.2
* Add system tests for Centos 5

2.1.0
=====

This release is primarily a feature release, introducing some new helpful constructs to the module.

For starters, we've added the line `include 'postgresql_conf_extras.conf'` by default so extra parameters not managed by the module can be added by other tooling or by Puppet itself. This provides a useful escape-hatch for managing settings that are not currently managed by the module today.

We've added a new defined resource for managing your tablespace, so you can now create new tablespaces using the syntax:

    postgresql::tablespace { 'dbspace':
      location => '/srv/dbspace',
    }

We've added a locale parameter to the `postgresql` class, to provide a default. Also the parameter has been added to the `postgresql::database` and `postgresql::db` defined resources for changing the locale per database:

    postgresql::db { 'mydatabase':
      user     => 'myuser',
      password => 'mypassword',
      encoding => 'UTF8',
      locale   => 'en_NG',
    }

There is a new class for installing the necessary packages to provide the PostgreSQL JDBC client jars:

    class { 'postgresql::java': }

And we have a brand new defined resource for managing fine-grained rule sets within your pg_hba.conf access lists:

    postgresql::pg_hba { 'Open up postgresql for access from 200.1.2.0/24':
      type => 'host',
      database => 'app',
      user => 'app',
      address => '200.1.2.0/24',
      auth_method => 'md5',
    }

Finally, we've also added Travis-CI support and unit tests to help us iterate faster with tests to reduce regression. The current URL for these tests is here: https://travis-ci.org/puppetlabs/puppet-postgresql. Instructions on how to run the unit tests available are provided in the README for the module.

A big thanks to all those listed below who made this feature release possible :-).

Notable features:

   * Add support for versions of postgres other than the system default version
     (which varies depending on OS distro).  This includes optional support for
     automatically managing the package repo for the "official" postgres yum/apt
     repos.  (Major thanks to Etienne Pelletier <epelletier@maestrodev.com> and
     Ken Barber <ken@bob.sh> for their tireless efforts and patience on this
     feature set!)  For example usage see `tests/official-postgresql-repos.pp`.

   * Add some support for Debian Wheezy and Ubuntu Quantal

   * Add new `postgres_psql` type with a Ruby provider, to replace the old
     exec-based `psql` type.  This gives us much more flexibility around
     executing SQL statements and controlling their logging / reports output.

   * Major refactor of the "spec" tests--which are actually more like
     acceptance tests.  We now support testing against multiple OS distros
     via vagrant, and the framework is in place to allow us to very easily add
     more distros.  Currently testing against Cent6 and Ubuntu 10.04.

   * Fixed a bug that was preventing multiple databases from being owned by the
     same user
     (9adcd182f820101f5e4891b9f2ff6278dfad495c - Etienne Pelletier <epelletier@maestrodev.com>)

   * Add support for ACLs for finer-grained control of user/interface access
     (b8389d19ad78b4fb66024897097b4ed7db241930 - dharwood <harwoodd@cat.pdx.edu>)

   * Many other bug fixes and improvements!
