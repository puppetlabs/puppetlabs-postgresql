# Class: postgresql::config::afterservice

# Parameters:

#   [*postgres_password*]     - postgres db user password.

# Actions:

#
# Usage:
#   This class is not intended to be used directly; it is
#   managed by postgresl::config.  It contains resources
#   that should be handled *after* the postgres service
#   has been started up.
