# TODO: in mysql module, the grant resource name might look like this: 'user@host/dbname';
#  I think that the API for the resource type should split these up, because it's
#  easier / safer to recombine them for mysql than it is to parse them for other
#  databases.  Also, in the mysql module, the hostname portion of that string
#  affects the user's ability to connect from remote hosts.  In postgres this is
#  managed via pg_hba.conf; not sure if we want to try to reconcile that difference
#  in the modules or not.

  # TODO: FIXME: only works on databases, due to using has_database_privilege

  # TODO: this is a terrible hack; if they pass "ALL" as the desired privilege,
  #  we need a way to test for it--and has_database_privilege does not recognize
  #  'ALL' as a valid privilege name.  So we probably need to hard-code a mapping
  #  between 'ALL' and the list of actual privileges that it entails, and loop
  #  over them to check them.  That sort of thing will probably need to wait until
  #  we port this over to ruby, so, for now, we're just going to assume that if
  #  they have "CREATE" privileges on a database, then they have "ALL".  (I told
  #  you that it was terrible!)
