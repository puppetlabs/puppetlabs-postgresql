# Define: postgresql::validate_db_connection
#
# This type validates that a successful postgres connection can be established
# between the node on which this resource is run and a specified postgres
# instance (host/port/user/password/database name).
#
# Parameters:
#   [*database_host*]       - the hostname or IP address of the machine where the
#                             postgres server should be running.
#   [*database_port*]       - the port on which postgres server should be
#                             listening (defaults to 5432).
#   [*database_username*]   - the postgres username
#   [*database_password*]   - the postgres user's password
#   [*database_name*]       - the database name that the connection should be
#                             established against
#
# NOTE: to some degree this type assumes that you've created the corresponding
# postgres database instance that you are validating by using the
# `postgresql::db` or `postgresql::database` type provided by this module
# elsewhere in your manifests.
#
# Actions:
#
# Attempts to establish a connection to the specified postgres database.  If
#  a connection cannot be established, the resource will fail; this allows you
#  to use it as a dependency for other resources that would be negatively
#  impacted if they were applied without the postgres connection being available.
#
# Requires:
#
#  `psql` commandline tool (will automatically install the system's postgres
#                           client package if it is not already installed.)
#
# Sample Usage:
#
#  postgresql::validate_db_connection { 'validate my postgres connection':
#      database_host           => 'my.postgres.host',
#      database_username       => 'mydbuser',
#      database_password       => 'mydbpassword',
#      database_name           => 'mydbname',
#  }
#

      require     => Package['postgresql-client'],
    }

    # This is a little bit of puppet magic.  What we want to do here is make
    # sure that if the validation and the database instance creation are being
    # applied on the same machine, then the database resource is applied *before*
    # the validation resource.  Otherwise, the validation is guaranteed to fail
    # on the first run.
    #
    # We accomplish this by using Puppet's resource collection syntax to search
    # for the Database resource in our current catalog; if it exists, the
    # appropriate relationship is created here.
